Oracle Java on Docker
=====
This repository contains a sample Docker configuration to facilitate installation and environment setup for DevOps users. This project includes a Dockerfile for JDK 14, JDK 11, and Server JRE 8 based on Oracle Linux.

Oracle Java Server JRE provides the features from Oracle Java JDK commonly required for server-side applications (i.e. Running a Java EE application server). For more information about Server JRE, visit the [Understanding the Server JRE blog entry](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/understanding-the-server-jre) from the Java Product Management team.

## Building the Java 14 (JDK) base image
[Download JDK 14](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk14-downloads.html) `.tar.gz` file and drop it inside the folder `../OracleJava/14`.

Build it using:

```
$ cd ../OracleJava/14
$ docker build -t oracle/jdk:14 .
```

## Building the Java 11 (JDK) base image
[Download JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) `.tar.gz` file and drop it inside the folder `../OracleJava/11`.

Build it using:

```
$ cd ../OracleJava/11
$ docker build -t oracle/jdk:11 .
```


## Building the Java 8 (Server JRE) base image
[Download Server JRE 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-server-jre8-downloads.html) `.tar.gz` file and drop it inside the folder `../OracleJava/8`.
